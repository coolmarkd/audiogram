1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
<v A>I did have a friend who had Sonic. I

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.759
<v A>mean, not Sonic, SEGA cd. And they had this crazy,

3
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.400
<v A>like, weird FMV game.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.439
<v B>Oh, there was Sewer Shark. That every. Sewer shark.

5
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.720
<v A>Yes, the worst. Yes, the worst. Yes. That's

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.800
<v A>exactly what I got to experience. And I'm like, why is this game the

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.960
<v A>worst thing on the planet?

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.000
<v B>I feel like everything that comes bundled and is bad, we should just call

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v B>a sewer shark. You know, like when

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.079
<v B>you. When you had an Xbox360 and you bought the HD

11
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.100
<v B>DVD player and it came with Peter Jackson's King Kong, it actually came with

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.780
<v B>Sewer card.

13
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.740
<v A>Yeah, pretty much.

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.820
<v A>That's true.

15
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.820
<v B>Hey, this is episode 1616

16
00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.259
<v B>of Weekly Deliverables and it's called the Spicy Nugget.

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.000
<v B>This is definitely a spicy nug. I am

18
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:03.200
<v B>Mark.

19
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.200
<v A>I am Alex.

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
<v C>And I'm Pedro.

21
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.200
<v B>And today we're talking about fast food, apparently.

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.840
<v C>Yeah, well, so we kind of wanted to bring up a little.

23
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.760
<v C>A little topic about team environments and,

24
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.359
<v C>you know, some of the positives and negatives of working in a team

25
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.000
<v C>during projects and did we touch on this.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.920
<v B>A little bit before?

27
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.120
<v C>We might have, to some extent.

28
00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.359
<v B>We have an extensive catalog and sometimes.

29
00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.319
<v A>It'S just hard to remember.

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.920
<v C>I'm not 100% on that.

31
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.659
<v A>I think that maybe we went over the kind of like

32
00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:37.260
<v A>an overview.

33
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.980
<v B>Okay.

34
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.980
<v A>Coming out of this contract gig.

35
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.219
<v B>Right. Okay. So you have some experience to.

36
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.739
<v C>Yeah, we have a. Yeah. If. If we do. If we have covered it, then maybe

37
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.819
<v C>we can just. Yeah, well, we. We had an episode on

38
00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.459
<v C>team dynamics. Right, Right. This is not so much team dynamics

39
00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.540
<v C>as it is being in

40
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.980
<v C>a team versus not being in a team.

41
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.659
<v B>Gotcha.

42
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.420
<v A>Some of the pros and cons.

43
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.780
<v C>Some of the pros and cons. Right.

44
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
<v C>So, yeah, man. It's a deep, deep

45
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.990
<v C>well of things to talk about.

46
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.430
<v A>I think that for the most part,

47
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.110
<v A>when you think of a team environment. Right. Everybody

48
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.949
<v A>kind of thinks of maybe like the Mighty Ducks or something.

49
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.909
<v B>Quack.

50
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.949
<v A>Yeah, quack. Everybody sits getting together, hands in the

51
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.430
<v A>middle, throw your hands up. Everybody's going to do their job.

52
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.310
<v C>Blind V. There's a party in the usa.

53
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.750
<v A>Yeah.

54
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.189
<v B>Knuckle puck.

55
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.189
<v C>You never heard of my knuckle puck?

56
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.310
<v A>No, please.

57
00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.710
<v C>That's like my favorite one.

58
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.310
<v A>And in reality, it doesn't always end up

59
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.990
<v A>that way. People work at different paces. And

60
00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.669
<v A>when you are in a team environment, you have

61
00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.909
<v A>to kind of adhere to everybody's

62
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.310
<v A>strengths and. And more importantly, everybody's weaknesses.

63
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.669
<v B>Right.

64
00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.080
<v A>And I think that that was

65
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.120
<v A>very eye opening for me and it's kind of shown

66
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.520
<v A>me A little bit about,

67
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.479
<v A>I suppose, keeping a good record of

68
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.520
<v A>production and trying to meet some standards and

69
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.639
<v A>learning from each other as quickly as possible. Especially because the project

70
00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.719
<v A>I was working on, we were in a crunch, so there was no time

71
00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
<v A>to really sit down and code review and stuff like that. So you kind of just

72
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.780
<v A>had to look at someone else's work, see what they were doing and kind of meet

73
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.819
<v A>a standard if they were. If it was better than yours.

74
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:24.180
<v B>Right.

75
00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.659
<v A>But it made me think about what

76
00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.539
<v A>it means to actually work in

77
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.939
<v A>team and having to deal with contrasting ideas.

78
00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.819
<v A>Having to deal with, you know, being told no

79
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.099
<v A>when you have, like, the evidence that you're

80
00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.300
<v A>like, plan of attack is probably, like,

81
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300
<v A>the best. Not the best, but ideal to the situation

82
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.979
<v A>that you're in.

83
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.419
<v B>So almost like being on Facebook.

84
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.180
<v C>The.

85
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.340
<v B>Most contrary things that you will ever possibly think of, like your

86
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.620
<v B>family member just posts.

87
00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:58.060
<v A>Yeah.

88
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.500
<v B>You're just like, how do I. How do I be in a family with this person?

89
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.259
<v A>Exactly. You have to think, like, okay, like, I'm in this team,

90
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.580
<v A>and if you. Well, like me,

91
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.620
<v A>I was in a contract, so I'm obligated to be here. But I'm

92
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.740
<v A>also like, I need to be here, right. So I need to

93
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.860
<v A>make sure that I work well with these people despite, like, maybe

94
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.970
<v A>some of these contrasting ideas. So now you got to figure it out. You

95
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.930
<v A>can't just walk away from it, you know, it's just like family. You got to figure it out.

96
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.290
<v B>Yeah.

97
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.529
<v A>So, yeah, like, it was definitely,

98
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.529
<v A>definitely, definitely.

99
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.810
<v B>No, you can't do that anymore, man.

100
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.889
<v A>Definitely, definitely.

101
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.370
<v B>There's a whole spectrum disorder advocacy rights group, I'm sure,

102
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.850
<v B>really somewhere they don't.

103
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.050
<v A>Like that movie the Rain man.

104
00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.769
<v C>Maybe.

105
00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:44.250
<v B>Even though it helped bring awareness to it anyway.

106
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.060
<v A>Yeah. But I think that was awesome. Anyway.

107
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.540
<v B>Fine line between making fun of something and bringing awareness to it.

108
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.019
<v A>Lesson number one.

109
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.660
<v B>Yeah.

110
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.220
<v A>I think that when

111
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.259
<v A>you take on a project, right? So I'm going to think

112
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.339
<v A>of this from the bare bones. Let's just say it's just you, right? And you

113
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.420
<v A>take on a project by yourself only you have yourself to hold accountable,

114
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.980
<v A>right? So you're going to find ways to make yourself responsible

115
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.199
<v A>for achieving something. Right. When you take

116
00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.480
<v A>on a team project now, now,

117
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.519
<v A>it's not just you. Everybody else has to be accountable too,

118
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.879
<v A>right? And you have to hold them accountable, and they have to hold you accountable.

119
00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.959
<v A>But when someone sits in a really

120
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.120
<v A>important seat and they're kind

121
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.160
<v A>of, like, not producing or they're kind of just

122
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.360
<v A>kind of doing whatever it is to. To

123
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.519
<v A>halt the project in a way. Not on purpose, but,

124
00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:41.550
<v A>you know, kind of like, like as a result

125
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.269
<v A>or.

126
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.709
<v B>Right.

127
00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.230
<v A>As a consequence of their actions.

128
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.670
<v B>Yeah.

129
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.990
<v A>Then the project has a high possibility of coming to a

130
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.589
<v A>screeching hole.

131
00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.910
<v B>Yeah.

132
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.990
<v A>And that fucks with everybody who's working on the project.

133
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.790
<v B>Better believe it.

134
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.230
<v C>Yeah.

135
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.230
<v A>So it's. It's interesting to. To see

136
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.589
<v A>it happen. It's interesting to be a part of it. And

137
00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.949
<v A>it made me think, like, well, people

138
00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.230
<v A>need to know exactly what they're getting into when

139
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.269
<v A>they decide I'm going to get into a team or I'm going to build

140
00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:13.370
<v A>a team to do something. Because it's not just, all right, cool guys, let's

141
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.370
<v A>get together and do this. No, like, and especially

142
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.769
<v A>if you believe in the project that you're working in and you want to see it succeed,

143
00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.649
<v A>it has to be like a. Like, even

144
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.970
<v A>if it's with your friends, you have to now

145
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.529
<v A>treat each other as co workers and like respectable people.

146
00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.170
<v C>Which is really difficult.

147
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.050
<v B>Yeah, it's.

148
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.170
<v C>It's hard. It's very difficult because you can fall into the,

149
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.220
<v C>like, oh, they're my friends. Yeah, they'll get it. Of course, you know,

150
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.579
<v C>and it's like, no, you're kind of doing your friends a disservice

151
00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.339
<v C>if you're not, you know, putting forth, like, maximum effort.

152
00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.459
<v A>Yeah, right. And it's. It's

153
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:50.779
<v A>one of those things that I think that if you work with strangers,

154
00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:54.139
<v A>you fall into it less because I don't

155
00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.180
<v A>know if there's a psychological explanation for it, but

156
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.579
<v A>when you feel accountable with someone you don't know, you feel like you need to

157
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.339
<v A>step your game up. I don't know if you've ever felt that way.

158
00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.500
<v B>Well, maybe because we're Americans. Right. It's like the Wild west, where

159
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.579
<v B>it's like, oh, you didn't. You didn't bring these cattle and Pam and

160
00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:13.019
<v B>they just shoot. So we're conditioned

161
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.180
<v B>that way based on, like, childhood entertainment like

162
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:17.259
<v B>Yosemite Sam.

163
00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.139
<v C>I mean, it also, cross them and.

164
00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.860
<v B>He'Ll just shoot you.

165
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.939
<v C>I mean, it also makes you not a scumbag because if you care about, you know,

166
00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:25.220
<v C>performing with, you know, with people that,

167
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.779
<v C>that you don't know, because you feel accountable, you know, for what you're doing,

168
00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.980
<v C>it makes you not a scumbag. But if you don't feel that way with

169
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.060
<v C>your friends, you are a scumbag. Like, if you don't feel that

170
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.129
<v C>same amount of, like, respect, almost like, oh, I need to be

171
00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.170
<v C>accountable with my friends. Probably your friends more so because

172
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.730
<v C>you see these people all the time, like. Right. Instead of just strangers.

173
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.410
<v C>So it's like a weird psychology. Psychological.

174
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.089
<v A>I think it's, like, phenomena. Yeah, I think it's like a. Like a weird reverse.

175
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.209
<v A>Because with friends, you're kind of like, whatever about it.

176
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.290
<v A>Right. But with strangers, you're kind of really serious about it.

177
00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.970
<v B>Yeah, for sure.

178
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.050
<v A>And it's. It's interesting to think of

179
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.889
<v A>it like that or to see that, you know.

180
00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:07.800
<v B>I prefer my Wild west, like, explanation.

181
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.839
<v A>Yeah. Just getting shot.

182
00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:11.800
<v B>For the record, this is the explanation I support.

183
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.920
<v A>So if you guys listening here ever work for Mark, you're

184
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.959
<v A>gonna get shot if you.

185
00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.439
<v C>But he has to come in there 77, like, ghetto.

186
00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:24.519
<v A>If you hear spurs in the office that day, you're done.

187
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.600
<v C>I got the. The. The. The USA skin

188
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.519
<v C>out of a loot box recently for McCree.

189
00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:32.840
<v B>Oh.

190
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.799
<v C>So it's a little offshoot.

191
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.799
<v A>I was hoping that, like, you weren't talking about Overwatch for

192
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.120
<v A>a second.

193
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.879
<v B>I cannot talk.

194
00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.860
<v A>But it's just like, I got the USA skin. Yeah.

195
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.299
<v A>When did you get that?

196
00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.340
<v C>It's the USA ducks. Not the Mighty Ducks.

197
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.940
<v C>The USA ducks from D2. The Mighty Ducks.

198
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.899
<v A>Oh, my God.

199
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.899
<v B>We talk about Mighty Ducks all day.

200
00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.700
<v A>What did I do?

201
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.259
<v B>I mean, why did I say the word Mighty Ducks?

202
00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:57.539
<v C>You know, because ducks fly for already.

203
00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.100
<v A>They do.

204
00:08:58.179 --> 00:08:58.899
<v C>And fly together.

205
00:08:58.899 --> 00:08:59.539
<v A>Fly together.

206
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.419
<v B>Ducks still fly together. And as long as they fly in, they might as well

207
00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:04.179
<v B>fly forever.

208
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:04.700
<v A>Oh, shit.

209
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.539
<v B>Better late than never.

210
00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:06.659
<v C>There you go, Daniel.

211
00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:07.379
<v B>Pleasure.

212
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:08.419
<v C>Done. Yeah.

213
00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:10.700
<v B>You all just got Puff Daddy.

214
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.539
<v A>Yeah. And resurrect.

215
00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:14.620
<v C>Bigotry. Sloppy.

216
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.620
<v A>It also made me think, right.

217
00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:21.580
<v C>About.

218
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.620
<v A>What it means to not work in a team and what it means to

219
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.740
<v A>be accountable for yourself, right? And maybe

220
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.820
<v A>some. Something along the lines of creating strategies to make yourself

221
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.580
<v A>accountable for a passion project, Right?

222
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.889
<v A>And obviously it starts with the person they have to want

223
00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:41.090
<v A>to do this thing, right? And we've talked about this before. I

224
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.850
<v A>think it was one of our first or second episodes.

225
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.929
<v A>You know, the want to actually do something. But then

226
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.289
<v A>I was thinking, well, what are some strategies that will help someone

227
00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:53.409
<v A>kind of stick to a schedule, right? And it's creating

228
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.970
<v A>sort of like

229
00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:59.409
<v A>what I want to say is superficial need to do something

230
00:09:59.809 --> 00:10:01.450
<v A>that benefits your project, Right?

231
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.169
<v B>Artificial need.

232
00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:03.879
<v A>Maybe Artificially. Yeah.

233
00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:06.960
<v B>Yeah. Because superficials like, it doesn't really matter. It just looks like it

234
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.440
<v B>matters.

235
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.759
<v A>Right.

236
00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.480
<v C>Well, that too.

237
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:11.360
<v B>Artificial need is that you. You. You create this, like,

238
00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:15.399
<v B>deadline or whatever. You're like, if I don't do it by this date,

239
00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.639
<v B>I am actually garbage, right? So you're not.

240
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.799
<v B>Right if you miss your deadline. But also you want to think that way

241
00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.279
<v B>because you want to make your.

242
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.720
<v C>Because you might be garbage.

243
00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:25.279
<v B>Yeah.

244
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.279
<v A>Because you might end up in the trash bin. But I was thinking

245
00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.309
<v A>like there now it made me think

246
00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:34.590
<v A>of the people who go on to Twitch and host dev streams,

247
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.190
<v A>art streams and stuff like that. That to me is that artificial.

248
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:41.309
<v B>Like that artificial manufacturing that need to produce.

249
00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:44.389
<v A>Exactly. They're like, well, if I stream today, then I'll get to work

250
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.629
<v A>two hours on whatever it is. And if you stream like Monday,

251
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:50.909
<v A>Wednesday, Friday, now it's three days out of the week that you're actually

252
00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.909
<v A>working on your project, even though it's kind of like you should be

253
00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:56.360
<v A>doing that anyway. Now you've kind of.

254
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.799
<v B>But here's the difference though. When you build audience, you have to be consistent.

255
00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:00.720
<v A>You do. Yeah.

256
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.919
<v B>Right. So that's where that manufactured game comes in.

257
00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.480
<v C>If you end up building audience.

258
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.960
<v A>Yeah.

259
00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:08.120
<v B>I'm just saying the one way you do it is by being consistent.

260
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.440
<v A>Right.

261
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.480
<v B>Like it's guaranteed if you can't stream consistently, you will never

262
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.080
<v B>have an audience.

263
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.480
<v A>Right.

264
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:12.960
<v B>Whatever.

265
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.279
<v C>Right.

266
00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.559
<v A>But it also comes down to, let's say, I guess, even in the

267
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.519
<v A>same way of an audience. But it's a different kind of audience if you write a blog

268
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.000
<v A>or you start creating tutorials. Exactly right. That'll keep you

269
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.759
<v A>always consistent on making stuff and always

270
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.179
<v A>kind of working towards your end goal. And

271
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.539
<v A>I thought about that as like, okay, so if you're a solo guy,

272
00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:35.580
<v A>you're not working in a team and you need some

273
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.019
<v A>motivational push to go forward, try to find that artificial

274
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.100
<v A>kind of like, now I'm manufacturing my need kind

275
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.419
<v A>of thing.

276
00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:43.100
<v B>Yeah, for sure.

277
00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:45.580
<v A>I think that's pretty cool.

278
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.940
<v A>I am hoping to go down that path soon.

279
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.500
<v B>Are you going to start dev streaming then?

280
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.700
<v A>Yes. I've been in the process of setting

281
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.019
<v A>up a Twitch channel.

282
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.610
<v B>Nice.

283
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.610
<v A>Because I kind of want to just test it out and see how it

284
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.529
<v A>goes. I'm going to do a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule

285
00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:05.009
<v A>and just do maximum to minimum one

286
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:05.289
<v A>hour.

287
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.049
<v B>Okay.

288
00:12:06.049 --> 00:12:09.049
<v A>And test it out. And if, like, if I see

289
00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:12.049
<v A>that I like it just because it's motivating me

290
00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:15.210
<v A>or pushing me forward, then I'll extend the time or. Or find

291
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.450
<v A>like a good average time to stream.

292
00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:20.970
<v B>Okay. Like, what's your. What's your policy on trolls in chat?

293
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.009
<v A>Bottom.

294
00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:24.799
<v B>So basically you're saying I can't be in chat.

295
00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:28.399
<v A>Oh, wait, no. Well, okay. So

296
00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:32.080
<v A>I think that my humor, my range of humor

297
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.200
<v A>is pretty wide. So if it's to me, I'll understand.

298
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.000
<v A>Right?

299
00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:36.960
<v B>Yeah.

300
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.159
<v A>But if it's to a stranger.

301
00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:39.679
<v B>Oh, no strangers.

302
00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:42.159
<v A>Yeah. Then it's kind of like. Well, okay, yeah.

303
00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:45.399
<v C>It's like, don't be a dick. You can be, you can be trolly, just

304
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.080
<v C>don't be a dick.

305
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.279
<v A>I mean like, if it's to me, be a dick, be a troll, whatever. I understand.

306
00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:53.039
<v A>Like we're all friends here and I know the range of humor.

307
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:53.399
<v A>Right?

308
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:56.539
<v B>Yeah. Like I get in to my friend's destiny chat and I'm like, why is everybody playing

309
00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:57.100
<v B>McCree?

310
00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:00.539
<v A>You see? And that's fine.

311
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.620
<v C>That's funny.

312
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.779
<v A>Yeah. But, but if it's to like a stranger and like

313
00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:07.860
<v A>someone's being like this absolute dick, to like someone who just joined the

314
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.299
<v A>channel or like just like berating

315
00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:13.659
<v A>somebody, then I won't, I won't stand for that kind of thing.

316
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.820
<v B>Okay, so maybe I'm more of a heckler than.

317
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.899
<v A>Yeah, I mean, hecklers are always invited,

318
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:23.500
<v A>but that was a selfless plug. I didn't even think I was gonna mention

319
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:23.779
<v A>that.

320
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.059

<v B>How do you spell that?

324
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:34.259
<v A>Demon eye. As in the eyeball in your head.

325
00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:34.620
<v B>Okay.

326
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.620
<v A>And then Jin J I N. Like Jin Kazuya.

327
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.019
<v B>Yeah, like Tekken Jim.

328
00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:40.460
<v A>Yeah, like Tekken Jin. Yeah.

329
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.139
<v C>Tekken Jim.

330
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.899
<v A>Tekken Jim.

331
00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:42.659
<v C>Slim Jim.

332
00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:45.940
<v A>Tekken Jim. Holy. Now I want that game.

333
00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:48.340
<v A>He's just like this hillbilly guy.

334
00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:51.899
<v B>Serious. Tekken gym dispersed.

335
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.580
<v C>I don't know if it's like a. In Scary Movie and it's like buy big

336
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.860
<v C>gym, little gym, Slim Jim.

337
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.460
<v B>Oh my God.

338
00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:01.980
<v C>Walked away and it's like his trailer is like right on the school.

339
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.179
<v C>And it's like, how's this kid always late? He lives on like in

340
00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:05.500
<v C>school.

341
00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:12.259
<v A>Yeah. So those are

342
00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:15.419
<v A>some of the things that I've been thinking about, especially when you're getting into solo dev.

343
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.700
<v A>Coming out of a team environment where I was like obligated.

344
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.700
<v A>I also have another team environment which I work with Pedro

345
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.779
<v A>and Go War Games. But we've definitely,

346
00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:28.220
<v A>definitely, definitely.

347
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.299
<v B>Oh my God.

348
00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:30.139
<v A>I'm going to keep going.

349
00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:31.019
<v B>Go for it.

350
00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:32.220
<v C>Definitely.

351
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.340
<v A>We've learned a lot. And I think that one of our biggest hurdles in that environment

352
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.539
<v A>is that we're all friends.

353
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.500
<v B>Right.

354
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.740
<v A>So that one is like the tough thing to

355
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.179
<v A>handle.

356
00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:41.980
<v B>Yeah, for sure.

357
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.509
<v A>Being able to know how and when to step in to address something

358
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:48.269
<v A>and not wanting to hurt your friends feelings.

359
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:51.509
<v C>Call somebody out without. Without making sure that like

360
00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:54.830
<v C>you insult them. Right. Because calling somebody out for, like, bad work or,

361
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.870
<v C>like, slow work or just no work or just any. Any kind of

362
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.909
<v C>issue is really difficult to do already, even if you're not friends.

363
00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:03.509
<v C>Right. Because it's almost like you're. You're.

364
00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:07.110
<v C>You're shitting on, like, they're like, their honor. Right.

365
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:08.190
<v C>In a way.

366
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:08.629
<v A>Yeah.

367
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:11.350
<v C>Or at least you're calling it out. But then when you're. You're a friend,

368
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.590
<v C>it's very difficult to do that, too, because

369
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.490
<v C>people can't help but take it personal.

370
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:16.889
<v A>Right.

371
00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:18.570
<v C>Not just from a work stance, but it's like.

372
00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:19.009
<v A>Yeah.

373
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:20.490
<v C>You know, from a friend stance, too.

374
00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:23.210
<v A>There's no separation of church and state there anymore.

375
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.490
<v B>Yeah, for sure. And you can't just be like, you suck McBain and walk out.

376
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:28.250
<v B>That's your friend.

377
00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:31.970
<v A>Yeah, right, Exactly. So it makes walking on eggshells

378
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.090
<v A>even more difficult. Like, there are eggshells on top of those eggshells,

379
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.129
<v A>and you got to walk on those.

380
00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:39.169
<v B>I guess maybe the. The trick there, and it's not like

381
00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:41.850
<v B>a silver bullet, but everybody just kind of has to meet in the middle.

382
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:42.649
<v C>Yeah.

383
00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:45.690
<v B>They're like, your friends need to be able to maybe take criticism

384
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.730
<v B>a little better. And the people giving the criticism maybe just pull, like, a

385
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.490
<v B>little bit of the punch.

386
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.330
<v A>Yeah, yeah.

387
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.210
<v B>You know, so. But everybody has to understand that that's what's happening.

388
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.730
<v C>Yeah. It says you can't.

389
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.250
<v A>Healthy exercise right now.

390
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.610
<v C>You can't pull it off for the punch so that there is no punch.

391
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.610
<v B>Right, right, exactly. So it's a meat in the middle

392
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.009
<v B>thing, I think.

393
00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:04.129
<v A>I wonder if there's, like, a trust.

394
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:07.289
<v B>Fall extra small ropes course. I'm

395
00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:09.129
<v B>just gonna let you fall about, like, 10ft.

396
00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:12.049
<v A>Yeah. Then I'll catch it.

397
00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:12.409
<v B>Y.

398
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.590
<v A>I wonder. Yeah, that. That's curious. All right. I'm gonna think about

399
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.149
<v A>that one for a bit after this show. Yeah, for sure.

400
00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:23.269
<v C>Yeah. I mean, there has to be something, right? I'm sure.

401
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:24.870
<v A>Boxing ring match. You just got.

402
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.070
<v C>Oh, that'll be fish. Well, yeah, I mean, get like, some Rockham. Rockham soccer

403
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.629
<v C>robots, bro. Like, soccer bobbers or something. Or like.

404
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:33.509
<v B>No, it's just, like, a straight punch. Yeah, like

405
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:34.470
<v B>commercials.

406
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.429
<v A>Alive. Sock emboppers, bro. I took one to the face,

407
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:40.750
<v A>and that was like, that thing wasn't even there. But that's because me and my

408
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.669
<v A>friend were just going at it.

409
00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:43.549
<v C>Yeah, well, you guys are boosted animals.

410
00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:45.470
<v A>Well, I mean, did you see the commercial?

411
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.450
<v C>Y. Yeah. Well, there's this thing I've seen in,

412
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:52.330
<v C>like, parks or just, like, little, like, amusement. Not amusement

413
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.690
<v C>parks, but you know, when there's like a company party and something that like those like inflatable

414
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.730
<v C>things. There's one that's like an arena with two stumps and like

415
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.129
<v C>these giant, like, I think these giant

416
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.809
<v C>foam like bars and you.

417
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.609
<v A>Gladiator. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.650
<v C>Well, the joust, right? That's awesome. And I feel like

419
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.769
<v C>that's a good way to like.

420
00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:14.289
<v A>I remember was the weirdest, like scripted

421
00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:17.339
<v A>WWE thing. Like it tried to meet that

422
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.619
<v A>like thing where it's like these fighters would fight, but

423
00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.299
<v A>it was also like the scripted event.

424
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.460
<v B>You know, listen, I was just super about the tennis ball machine gun

425
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.539
<v B>and how did I get one?

426
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.180
<v A>The tennis ball machine gun.

427
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.220
<v B>It was like an arena set out and you had

428
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.339
<v B>like pylons, like obstacles, and then there was

429
00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:37.339
<v B>a dude with a tennis ball like turret.

430
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.619
<v C>Oh, my God.

431
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.099
<v A>Yeah.

432
00:17:40.099 --> 00:17:43.190
<v B>And then you had to like hit a little target like with an

433
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.269
<v B>arrow or something that you had like two or three of. So you had to get

434
00:17:46.269 --> 00:17:49.309
<v B>close enough to hit it reliably. And the dude, this swole

435
00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:52.150
<v B>ass, roided out dude, like shooting tennis balls at you relentlessly.

436
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.509
<v C>That sounds like it hurts. Yeah. You have a goddamn tennis ball.

437
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.910
<v B>I saw somebody get hit in the ankle one time and like limp off.

438
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.589
<v C>Oh, my God.

439
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:00.990
<v B>Normally people get hit like in the.

440
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.390
<v C>Chest and you take it to the chest.

441
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.829
<v B>Yeah.

442
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:05.950
<v C>No, that shit sounds crazy, dude.

443
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.430
<v A>No, but that show is pretty crazy.

444
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.509
<v C>Yeah. I mean, well, that's one thing, right? But yeah,

445
00:18:10.509 --> 00:18:12.869
<v C>so definitely, you know, working in that team environment,

446
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.029
<v C>as always, there's always like some positives to it, which

447
00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:20.349
<v C>I guess one of the positive be that if you are working in a team environment, you

448
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.390
<v C>can tackle on maybe bigger projects or finish

449
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.390
<v C>a project in a shorter amount of time. Yeah. You

450
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.549
<v C>know, as long as everybody is inputting what they're supposed to at least write and

451
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:31.750
<v C>according to whatever plan you got.

452
00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:34.549
<v A>Yeah, that's the. That's the ideal scenario

453
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.000
<v A>where everybody's kind of, you know, pulling their own weight. A

454
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.160
<v A>project then, which for one person would

455
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.359
<v A>be a long time, would, in

456
00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:47.400
<v A>my opinion, get shortened down by half or less, depending on what

457
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.279
<v A>that project is.

458
00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:48.759
<v B>Right.

459
00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:53.400
<v A>And I'm not sure. I think

460
00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:57.359
<v A>you've seen this before and stuff like when more people tackle onto

461
00:18:57.359 --> 00:19:00.680
<v A>something, it's less workload on someone else. And

462
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.799
<v A>as the work gets divided, you get to

463
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:07.000
<v A>kind of really enjoy

464
00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:10.140
<v A>or get to maybe enjoy not the right word, but you

465
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.700
<v A>get to dive into your responsibilities.

466
00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:12.259
<v B>Yeah.

467
00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:15.299
<v A>You know, you get to kind of seclude yourself and say, all right, now this is my

468
00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:18.339
<v A>responsibility. Let me Let me get at this like

469
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.539
<v A>100%.

470
00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:22.619
<v B>Yeah, absolutely. I was actually having an interesting discussion with somebody

471
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.140
<v B>that works at a real company essentially. Oh,

472
00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:26.619
<v B>a real software company.

473
00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:28.579
<v A>Oh no, you heard me.

474
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.900
<v B>Where they make like boring software. Yeah.

475
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.019
<v B>They were telling me that being in a, in a position where

476
00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:37.549
<v B>they manage like an entire

477
00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:41.390
<v B>like 20 something people, maybe like what one would

478
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.589
<v B>consider a product or a division. Yeah, it's a lot

479
00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:48.589
<v B>more difficult because it's a lot more people wrangling versus

480
00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:51.750
<v B>working on a smaller project where you had a lot of your scope

481
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.869
<v B>was, was narrower. So you had a lot more of a deep dive

482
00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:56.990
<v B>into the, the technicality of it.

483
00:19:57.069 --> 00:19:57.470
<v A>Right?

484
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:58.910
<v B>Yeah, yeah.

485
00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:02.470
<v C>But I think also part of working on the team though too, especially with more people, is

486
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.529
<v C>that you don't have to worry about all these crazy

487
00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:08.650
<v C>amount of stuff that you have to like bring together as well as like, oh, my job is

488
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:08.930
<v C>this.

489
00:20:09.089 --> 00:20:09.490
<v A>Right.

490
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.369
<v C>Like I can only focus on this and do it really well instead of like

491
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.009
<v C>getting scared of the scope. Right. It's like, oh, I have to do all

492
00:20:16.009 --> 00:20:17.809
<v C>these different things.

493
00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:20.849
<v B>Yeah, for sure. Even though I would say that understanding at

494
00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:24.049
<v B>least a little bit about the rest of the. Yes, the thing always helps.

495
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.609
<v A>Absolutely.

496
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.970
<v C>It's always good to know like the overall scope and what everything.

497
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.369
<v B>You shouldn't be taking up your time, but it's good to know it.

498
00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:30.890
<v C>Yeah, of course.

499
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.730
<v B>Yeah, I guess that's the, the most like succinct way to put it.

500
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.009
<v C>Yeah.

501
00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:37.190
<v A>I think understand understanding the pipeline and knowing how

502
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.589
<v A>things get implemented, even from like a non programmer

503
00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:44.029
<v A>to a programmer standpoint, it will help everybody

504
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:47.309
<v A>kind of unify in the middle. When you do have to meet in the middle, like,

505
00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:50.710
<v A>okay, like the programming's done, here comes the art. Okay,

506
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.789
<v A>we talked about the pipeline, so I know that I'm going to be receiving the art

507
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:56.789
<v A>like this and they're going to do the art like that. So let me just start setting

508
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:59.349
<v A>up those things, these templates ahead of time.

509
00:20:59.349 --> 00:21:02.269
<v B>Right. You have enough knowledge to be proactive

510
00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:04.369
<v B>in how you work with the rest of the team.

511
00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:05.410
<v A>Right, right, right.

512
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.369
<v B>Yeah.

513
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.450
<v C>But then, you know, so it's always, always nice. Right. If you have a

514
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.529
<v C>team and you can feel like you got a lot done. But then like

515
00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:16.529
<v C>we said before coming into a team, there's always like negatives and

516
00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:19.650
<v C>I think one of the biggest ones at least that we've

517
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.769
<v C>come across, if it's. If one of the people that are

518
00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:25.490
<v C>like, I guess driving the project is just like

519
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.009
<v C>not about the project or is not performing well or anything. Then,

520
00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:32.049
<v C>like, it kind of shits on the whole, like, team morale or like, everybody else, and it

521
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:34.839
<v C>kind of, like, almost completely stops the project

522
00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:35.720
<v C>from moving.

523
00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:37.319
<v B>Yeah, it can definitely.

524
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:40.880
<v C>That's a really shitty thing, and it's something to really watch out for if

525
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.720
<v C>you're in a team environment.

526
00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.559
<v A>But I will say that the

527
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.839
<v A>boon to it is, like, an

528
00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:51.920
<v A>endless supply of motivating

529
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.920
<v A>factor. Right? If everybody's kind of working

530
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.880
<v A>and everybody's kind of doing what they're supposed to do, and you see that,

531
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:02.069
<v A>I tend to see me as always kind of like on

532
00:22:02.069 --> 00:22:05.150
<v A>an uphill battle. Right. And I like that feeling because I

533
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.190
<v A>like to be able to say, like, all right, let's climb. Right? Let's do this. All right, let's

534
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.509
<v A>meet this. And it kind of motivates me to keep producing

535
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:14.509
<v A>even if I don't feel good about what I'm producing, even if I feel

536
00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:17.710
<v A>like, oh, well, I could have done this better, maybe, you know, whatever.

537
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.710
<v A>I still move forward, and I still tell myself,

538
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.750
<v A>all right, like, fuck it, like, that's behind me now. I finished

539
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.309
<v A>my to do list. I'll review it when there's time.

540
00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:30.839
<v A>Let me just, you know, keep going. Because these guys are.

541
00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:31.720
<v A>Keep, like, they.

542
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.119
<v C>They're.

543
00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:35.119
<v A>They continue to climb. So I'm like, all right, let's keep climbing. Let's

544
00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:38.079
<v A>do this and keep swimming, bro. Yeah,

545
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.559
<v A>it basically becomes that, like, as long as you see people swimming,

546
00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:44.599
<v A>and the way I always perceive it is that they're swimming in front of me, it

547
00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:47.680
<v A>makes me want to catch up, and it makes me want to swim harder, and it makes me want

548
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.319
<v A>to go faster.

549
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.319
<v B>Yeah, for sure. You got to call those discords.

550
00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:51.119
<v C>Gotta go fast.

551
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.589
<v A>I'm a pretty good Zenyatta. I'm not lying.

552
00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:56.549
<v B>Yeah, there you go. You call out your discords.

553
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.789
<v A>I do.

554
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:57.789
<v C>I'm waiting for the rework.

555
00:22:57.789 --> 00:23:00.430
<v B>Like, the hugest key. Yeah, call out your discord.

556
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:01.430
<v A>I call out my rework.

557
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.470
<v B>Is that everything is a five ball and everybody dies. That's

558
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.150
<v B>the rework for Zenyatta, man.

559
00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:09.150
<v A>I could only wish.

560
00:23:10.509 --> 00:23:12.829
<v C>We'll see here. They already got mercy.

561
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.390
<v B>Mercy of the apocalypse, man.

562
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.390
<v A>That change. I'll play mercy.

563
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.230
<v B>Like, they already had to nerf her.

564
00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:21.960
<v A>They already had to nerf her, dude.

565
00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:23.559
<v B>Did you see gameplay?

566
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.119
<v A>No, I didn't get to see gameplay.

567
00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:26.680
<v B>It was like, everybody's alive, mercy.

568
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:26.920
<v C>Ol.

569
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.799
<v B>Everybody's dead.

570
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.519
<v C>I saw that. I saw that clip. Yeah,

571
00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.880
<v C>they ana boosted her, and then she went ult.

572
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.519
<v A>Of course they did.

573
00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:41.799
<v C>Good luck. Everything dies. Everything just drops dead.

574
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.880
<v A>Yeah, because Anytime you give someone a damage boost, there's

575
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.079
<v A>always the possibility of getting the Anna fucking Super on

576
00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:48.319
<v A>you.

577
00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:48.720
<v B>Yeah.

578
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.920
<v A>And that's it. You're just a monster in the field.

579
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.779
<v C>Yeah, it's gross.

580
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.740
<v A>Yeah. That's awesome, though.

581
00:23:56.819 --> 00:23:59.940
<v A>But yeah, like, I tend to take that as

582
00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.940
<v A>the. The push that I need

583
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.940
<v A>to keep going. And I think that a team environment is

584
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.339
<v A>really, really healthy for that kind of stuff. If you get into something where

585
00:24:09.339 --> 00:24:12.420
<v A>you see, like, everybody's kind of pulling their own weight and stuff,

586
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.819
<v A>I highly recommend it if you can get into a team or

587
00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:18.940
<v A>get into any kind of project that you want to get into.

588
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.019
<v A>And obviously this is not harking back into the team dynamics

589
00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:22.460
<v A>episode.

590
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:22.980
<v B>Right. Y.

591
00:24:23.369 --> 00:24:26.450
<v A>But I. I super highly recommend

592
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.609
<v A>it. And don't

593
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.970
<v A>start a team for your first project just yet.

594
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.089
<v A>Like, join someone else's team first.

595
00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:35.769
<v B>Okay. Yeah.

596
00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:36.849
<v A>See what it's like.

597
00:24:36.849 --> 00:24:39.849
<v C>Or learn your skills really well before even, like,

598
00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:43.049
<v C>joining a team. Like, you don't like. At least for me, like, I wouldn't

599
00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:46.049
<v C>want to figure out my skill by joining a team. Yeah,

600
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:47.369
<v C>I want to figure out my skill.

601
00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:50.279
<v A>I'm gonna say don't start at zero, but,

602
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.519
<v A>yeah, start at 25% and

603
00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:56.759
<v A>be honest. Don't tell someone that you're the fucking world.

604
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.039
<v A>And then some. Yeah, tell them, hey, Look, I have 25%

605
00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:03.119
<v A>of knowledge and I see you're working on this project. Do I have

606
00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:06.200
<v A>a fit in there or. No, they'll be honest with you and they're gonna tell you,

607
00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:09.480
<v A>like, oh, yeah, actually you could help us with this. Or right now we're

608
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.640
<v A>not looking for someone at the moment that. At the skill, we would look for something like this,

609
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.640
<v A>this, or this, you know, and don't be afraid

610
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.359
<v A>of that. Like, that's something that you're just gonna run into all the time.

611
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.720
<v A>But nine out of 10 times, if it's an indie project, they need the help

612
00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:25.160
<v A>and they'll welcome the help. And that's a good way to take you from 25

613
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.160
<v A>to 50 to 75 on that skill. Like, that skill

614
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.440
<v A>list.

615
00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:31.599
<v C>But on that same note, though, for the

616
00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:34.440
<v C>people in the indie project that are going to grab somebody,

617
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.480
<v C>like, make sure that somebody can do something.

618
00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:38.599
<v A>Yeah, of course.

619
00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:41.359
<v C>Like, that's on the other side too. Like, you have to do your homework on that person.

620
00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:44.559
<v A>Yeah. I mean, don't join a project and just fucking decide that

621
00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:47.640
<v A>you're going to disappear for four months and then your car breaks down and

622
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.180
<v A>then you left the build at home and, you know.

623
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.819
<v B>Like your cat at your computer.

624
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.779
<v A>Yeah, like.

625
00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:53.819
<v C>Yeah. And it things.

626
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.220
<v A>Like there's a. There's an important, like, social contract, I

627
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.460
<v A>think. Right. At least that's the way I

628
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.220
<v A>feel about it.

629
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.900
<v B>I agree with you.

630
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.940
<v A>There's a social contract that when you give someone your word, you gotta keep

631
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.259
<v A>it, man.

632
00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:07.579
<v B>Yeah. Because now you get shot.

633
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:10.779
<v A>Yeah, exactly. You're gonna get fucking shot out there.

634
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.140
<v A>I mean, in. In that sense, it's metaphorically

635
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.980
<v A>true because no one else is gonna want to work with you in the future.

636
00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:21.759
<v A>And the time it takes for you to recoup that loss, you

637
00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:24.359
<v A>know, you could have done so many things. Yeah, for sure.

638
00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:25.319
<v C>Yeah.

639
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.039
<v B>I feel like. No, go ahead. What I was gonna say

640
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.039
<v B>was very banal.

641
00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:33.400
<v C>I mean. Okay, well, I was gonna say, like, there's a positive.

642
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.000
<v C>I think, at least for me, coming from experience and anecdotal

643
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
<v C>evidence, there is a positive that can

644
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.079
<v C>come out of negatives of team environments, which is maybe

645
00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:46.349
<v C>pushing you to do something new that you didn't do before to fill in a gap.

646
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.980
<v C>Right. Like, hello. Yes. All right. So,

647
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.099
<v C>like, if you're in a team environment where, like, something isn't happening

648
00:26:53.099 --> 00:26:56.220
<v C>or like, something's happening at the pace that you want to, and then

649
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.460
<v C>it kind of motivates you to kind of take reins of that particular

650
00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:02.779
<v C>subject. Right. Or just like force you. Forces

651
00:27:02.779 --> 00:27:05.819
<v C>you to learn something new so that you can put it

652
00:27:05.819 --> 00:27:07.539
<v C>to whatever pace you feel is adequate.

653
00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:10.980
<v B>It definitely offers the opportunity to step up.

654
00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:14.099
<v C>Right? It offers the opportunity to step up and kind of like,

655
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.589
<v C>kind of just, you know, take over that and then not have any excuse.

656
00:27:17.589 --> 00:27:20.390
<v B>I'm not gonna pretend that every time that you do that, it's gonna be great.

657
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:24.230
<v C>No, you're right. It's not. But it's definitely a positive out of a

658
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.269
<v C>negative situation, right?

659
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.950
<v A>Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:32.309
<v A>Look at do is agree with it.

661
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.710
<v B>God, we're so agreeable today.

662
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:35.670
<v A>I know, right?

663
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.509
<v B>Can somebody say something like inflammatory?

664
00:27:37.509 --> 00:27:38.710
<v C>The beer hasn't kicked in yet.

665
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.829
<v B>I already started one.

666
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.750
<v B>No, let's start at one.

667
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.829
<v A>He's let hearted. I can't say

668
00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:49.990
<v A>it with the R because I don't want to get in trouble.

669
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.430
<v B>But then you're making fun of people with speech impediments or agents.

670
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.630
<v A>Oh, shit, I'm done.

671
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.910
<v B>No, you can be safe. Definitely, definitely.

672
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.950
<v A>I'm definitely, definitely not gonna be safe.

673
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.950
<v B>Yeah, let's just do every Dustin Hoffman movie. Mrs. Robinson,

674
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.150
<v B>are you trying to seduce me?

675
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.910
<v A>Bring me Peter Pan.

676
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.519
<v C>Was Tootsie Dustinhoffen.

677
00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:15.640
<v B>Yes. And he was a cross dresser, if memory serves.

678
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.680
<v C>Yeah, yeah. He dressed as a Lady. Because he was impersonating a lady. Yeah, basically.

679
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.480
<v C>It was a good movie.

680
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.720
<v A>Tootsie was what now?

681
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.119
<v C>Oh, it's a Dustin Hoffman movie.

682
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.039
<v B>It's widely acclaimed, I guess. Critically acclaimed.

683
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.920
<v C>Critically acclaimed.

684
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.799
<v B>And he's a cross dresser. Like, the whole movie.

685
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.920
<v C>Yeah. He dressed up like a lady because I think it was for like, a job

686
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.039
<v C>or something that he.

687
00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:33.799
<v B>It was like the first Mrs. Doubtfire.

688
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.960
<v C>Yeah. Yeah, in a way.

689
00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:36.680
<v A>Okay.

690
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.240
<v B>I haven't seen it yet, but I love it.

691
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.710
<v B>No, Tootsie. Oh, more. More times than I

692
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.029
<v B>need to.

693
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:45.069
<v C>I saw it in 12 grade.

694
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.950
<v B>Yeah.

695
00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:47.710
<v C>During AP Spanish class. Funny enough.

696
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:48.549
<v B>Okay.

697
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:50.029
<v A>Interesting class.

698
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:53.309
<v C>My AP Spanish teacher was a really stressor.

699
00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.750
<v C>He was a really big film guy. Like, he loved movies.

700
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.990
<v B>Did you just assume his gender?

701
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.190
<v C>Yeah, dude, I'm pretty sure. I'm

702
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.470
<v C>pretty sure about it. But he loved movies and he always showed us movies that explore

703
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:06.509
<v C>different, like, themes of.

704
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.079
<v B>Of interesting.

705
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:09.079
<v C>Of people. But then we wrote an essay on it in Spanish.

706
00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:11.039
<v B>Oh, that's cool. That's actually really awesome.

707
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.559
<v A>Dustin Hoffman, like, we saw in the.

708
00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.559
<v C>Movie is when I saw like, the Truman show for the first time.

709
00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:18.240
<v B>Oh, wow.

710
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.799
<v C>I think he, at the time, the illusion had just come

711
00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:25.200
<v C>out and he told us. I was like, one of the first movies in a long time that he's seen in theaters

712
00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.960
<v C>that he just really enjoyed the experience.

713
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.119
<v C>Great movie.

714
00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:30.160
<v B>No, that wasn't a great movie.

715
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.920
<v C>It was a great movie.

716
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.400
<v B>That was Kmart. The Prestige.

717
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.119
<v C>No, I.

718
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:35.279
<v A>They're different then they come around.

719
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.559
<v C>They came around the same time.

720
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.359
<v A>Same time. Right.

721
00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:41.180
<v C>Except the Prestige is like Chris Nolan and, like, really

722
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.299
<v C>shiny and flashy. Delusion is a little more gritty and, like, slower

723
00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:46.140
<v C>paced and a little more dramatic.

724
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.019
<v B>Is like.

725
00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:47.740
<v C>It's so good.

726
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.819
<v A>With Paul Giamatti.

727
00:29:48.819 --> 00:29:50.059
<v C>Yeah, with Paul Gatti.

728
00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.259
<v B>The illusionist is Ned Norton. M. Night Shyamalan

729
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.859
<v B>read the script for the precision is like, I can make this movie.

730
00:29:56.859 --> 00:29:57.339
<v A>I got this.

731
00:29:57.339 --> 00:30:00.460
<v C>Maybe. But that's the thing, right? M. Night Shyamalan's movies are actually

732
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.579
<v C>not bad. Like, script idea wise. Now

733
00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:06.299
<v C>execution. I don't know about directing. They.

734
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.059
<v A>I don't know if you saw Lady. Lady in the Lady.

735
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:10.019
<v C>I never saw Lady. The Lady.

736
00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:11.000
<v B>I didn't see that. That one either.

737
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.440
<v A>Because that movie, if I remember correctly,

738
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.559
<v A>did the trope where the one guy just like, like,

739
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.039
<v A>buffed up one arm. Right.

740
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.839
<v A>For specific reasons. But it ended up becoming that

741
00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.880
<v A>he was like Sir Gallaghan or something. One of the greatest

742
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.200
<v A>knights.

743
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.599
<v C>Funny.

744
00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:29.160
<v B>Oh, is that a King Arthur movie?

745
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.559
<v A>Yes.

746
00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:31.799
<v C>What lady, like, is the King Arthur movie?

747
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.200
<v B>Yeah, I had no idea I got to watch it.

748
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.319
<v A>But it's in modern times.

749
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.039
<v B>I get it.

750
00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:38.680
<v A>And like, oh, okay. They all live in this apartment.

751
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.349
<v A>Like, yeah, watch the movie.

752
00:30:41.349 --> 00:30:42.390
<v B>Oh, I kind of want to see this.

753
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.430
<v A>I mean, I. Yeah, Okay. I don't want

754
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.630
<v A>to say anything because I don't want to remove the hype from.

755
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.549
<v B>You already ruined it.

756
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:51.670
<v C>I mean, I like. I like Shyama films,

757
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.029
<v C>but I usually like. Because of their. Like, their screenplay or, like, their

758
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:58.029
<v C>story. I really don't like the way that he directs

759
00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:01.190
<v C>most of them, but, like, I Saw a Devil and it's the one in, like, the elevator.

760
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.630
<v C>And he didn't direct that one.

761
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.869
<v B>He.

762
00:31:02.869 --> 00:31:06.019
<v C>He wrote it. And I really like that movie a lot. I was like, man, this is pretty cool.

763
00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:10.569
<v C>And I still like Signs and, you know, obviously, like, what is like, Unbreakable

764
00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.289
<v C>and Six Sense and Sixth Sense.

765
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:14.089
<v B>Of course, everyone movies.

766
00:31:14.089 --> 00:31:14.970
<v A>Yeah, right.

767
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.329
<v C>But, you know, that was like.

768
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.450
<v A>That was the movie to put him on the. Yeah, it put him on

769
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:19.690
<v A>the.

770
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.730
<v C>Split was pretty good.

771
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.690
<v A>I never saw Split. I never got to see it.

772
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.049
<v C>Pretty.

773
00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.970
<v A>Science was a funny movie because I loved it.

774
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.849
<v C>I love Signs.

775
00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:30.250
<v B>I thought it was cool. But the alien scares the crap out of me, dude.

776
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.769
<v A>I thought that movie was just, like, super funny because, like, the aliens

777
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:36.809
<v A>are scary up until the end of the movie. And when they're no

778
00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:39.950
<v A>longer scary, what whatsoever. Instead of being like, okay,

779
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.990
<v A>so you take. You take the movie Alien or Aliens. The aliens are

780
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.269
<v A>always scary throughout the entire thing. And then at the end, you get, like, the calming

781
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:49.349
<v A>moment. Oh, we finally beat the big bad. Or we got away. And,

782
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:51.230
<v A>like, everybody's. And then there's like, whatever.

783
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.470
<v C>Oh, this one. The, like, they're all leaving, and then now one alien

784
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.630
<v C>comes in. It's like, swing away, Merle. Swing away.

785
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.670
<v A>And it's just immediately takes the power away from the aliens, and

786
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.670
<v A>it's just like, oh, the aliens are weak to water. Why did they even.

787
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.660
<v A>And yeah, and what. Why did they even come to this planet in the first

788
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.180
<v A>place? Makes them alien. Like, are they stupid?

789
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.299
<v B>This one. This planet is mostly water and was mostly

790
00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:14.660
<v B>wood.

791
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.460
<v A>Exactly. It's like, oh, that's our weakness.

792
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.740
<v A>Let's go there. Let's go explore this area.

793
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.099
<v C>Maybe it's new to them. They didn't know they were weak to it until they got there.

794
00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:26.180
<v B>Maybe they're aliens, dude. We don't know where they've been.

795
00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.539
<v C>Yeah. Where they're going.

796
00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:28.980
<v A>But you test this.

797
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.220
<v B>Where'd they come from? Where do they go?

798
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.220
<v A>But that's what I'm saying, like, these aliens were so stupid to just be like,

799
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.240
<v A>I'll just go in there, get on that lander.

800
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.279
<v B>Maybe they work for Ubisoft, dude. They're just like, let's release with all

801
00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:41.000
<v B>these bugs. No.

802
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.920
<v A>And we'll call it the Division.

803
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.480
<v B>Yeah.

804
00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:47.440
<v C>I don't know. I don't know. But I don't know. I like Amnesia Mama

805
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.000
<v C>alone. Except for, like, what he did to the Last Airbender was almost unexcusable.

806
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.200
<v B>Well, my thing is that every. Every movie sets up with a

807
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.359
<v B>huge twist at the end.

808
00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:55.680
<v A>Yeah.

809
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.799
<v C>Yeah. What a twist. Yeah.

810
00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:57.519
<v B>What the tweet?

811
00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.000
<v C>I mean, I like the Village, funny enough.

812
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.319
<v B>What the tweets I didn't like the Village was stupid.

813
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.440
<v C>It's a little slower.

814
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.559
<v A>But it was weird to me that, like, you had this supernatural

815
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.640
<v A>creature, and it ended up just being like, the

816
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.359
<v A>guy in the. In the village.

817
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.240
<v C>But that's the twist. The big twist was

818
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.960
<v C>even. Was even further at the end.

819
00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:17.599
<v B>Yeah.

820
00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:20.839
<v C>So take it forward, you know, Take it as you will.

821
00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:24.000
<v B>And Wayward Pines is pretty much the village. But

822
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.880
<v B>then the village again.

823
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.599
<v C>I haven't seen that.

824
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.519
<v A>I didn't see it.

825
00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:29.960
<v B>So think of the village with the twist, and then think of twisting the twist.

826
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.319
<v B>Huh?

827
00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:30.920
<v A>Oh, my God.

828
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.079
<v B>And then you have Wayward Pines.

829
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.450
<v C>So you're going back to no twist.

830
00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:36.480
<v B>No, you continue twisting. Twisted twist.

831
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.440
<v A>Oh, you get twister.

832
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:40.680
<v B>Twist. That's to the power of a twist. That's

833
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.480
<v B>to the power of twist.

834
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.359
<v C>Okay. Okay.

835
00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:43.440
<v B>Twist cubed, I guess.

836
00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:44.319
<v C>Interesting.

837
00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:45.480
<v B>Or toast square, maybe.

838
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.480
<v C>I haven't seen it, but like I

839
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.839
<v C>said, I like his stories. I'm not crazy about how. I guess he directs

840
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:55.759
<v C>mostly just his actors. He has good shots, but, like, a lot of his actors just

841
00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:58.839
<v C>act really awkward. And for some movies, that works because it fits, and

842
00:33:58.839 --> 00:33:59.849
<v C>then for some reason, it just doesn't.

843
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.880
<v B>Yeah, you right.

844
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.200
<v C>So I'm just like, oh, no Last Airbender, please.

845
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
<v C>You took that Patel good actor and almost made him trash

846
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.440
<v C>quality.

847
00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.079
<v A>Yeah.

848
00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:08.920
<v C>So I was like.

849
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.119
<v A>No, it was. It was weird casting on that movie and weird acting

850
00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:12.800
<v A>on that movie.

851
00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:14.280
<v C>For me, it was mostly.

852
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.239
<v B>We're like some weird science.

853
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.440
<v C>Like the casting. I can understand the casting. I thought it was okay.

854
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.519
<v C>I think on was. Was pretty well cast in the

855
00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:25.519
<v C>other guys from, like, the Ice People were not super well casted, I

856
00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:27.360
<v C>guess. Maybe. But they also just felt really awkward.

857
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:27.920
<v A>Mm.

858
00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:31.119
<v C>And I feel. But like, I. And last time, I know we're going, like, on

859
00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:34.219
<v C>a crazy rant, but the Last Airman, I like the Fact that he tried to

860
00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:36.860
<v C>cast, like, different, like, ethnicities for, like, the different.

861
00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:40.300
<v A>Yeah, different, like different tribes. Ethnicities.

862
00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:42.019
<v C>Yeah. And I thought that was cool.

863
00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:45.059
<v A>Yes, I think that that's cool. But as far as the actors

864
00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:45.820
<v A>are concerned.

865
00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:49.059
<v C>Yeah. I mean, Patel was awesome. The Fire Emperor was

866
00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:52.219
<v C>cool. I guess, like, all the fire guys are. Or like. Like, there were good actors

867
00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:52.699
<v C>and, like.

868
00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:55.900
<v A>Wait, was. Wasn't one of them. What's this dude?

869
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.500
<v A>He's a comedian.

870
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.039
<v A>He was on the Daily Show.

871
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.159
<v B>Oh.

872
00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:05.199
<v C>Actually, the fire lord, I

873
00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.480
<v C>feel, might have been a comedian.

874
00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:07.679
<v B>What? What?

875
00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:09.480
<v C>Yeah, Far Lord ozai, the movie guy.

876
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480
<v B>I didn't watch this movie.

877
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.480
<v C>Oh, you're. You're. Never mind.

878
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.760
<v A>They were just failing some. I.

879
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.159
<v A>I don't remember the movie too well. I just remember thinking, like, why I.

880
00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:22.159
<v B>Won'T watch anything called Avatar at this point. Like, Avatar

881
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.440
<v B>is ruined.

882
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.199
<v C>Not James Cameron's Avatar. Not bad.

883
00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:27.440
<v A>Apparently James Cameron.

884
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.400
<v C>Yeah.

885
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.119
<v A>Yeah. Apparently that changed ponytail.

886
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.079
<v A>But I saw and I was like.

887
00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:39.280
<v C>I went into that movie with zero knowledge of what it was, and I came

888
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.599
<v C>out pretty impressed. It was like.

889
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:42.400
<v A>It was entertaining.

890
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.679
<v C>Yeah.

891
00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:45.440
<v A>But I still think that James Cameron's best movies, Terminator 2,

892
00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:47.559
<v A>it's definitely one.

893
00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:48.599
<v C>Of his best movies. For sure.

894
00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:49.639
<v A>It's literally his best.

895
00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:50.519
<v C>I don't know what his best.

896
00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:53.039
<v A>And it is by far the best action movie you'll see.

897
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:55.400
<v B>I think Terminator 1 was better than Terminator.

898
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.309
<v A>No, Terminator 1 was.

899
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:59.829
<v B>Because it was essentially Alien 1 was good.

900
00:35:59.829 --> 00:36:00.949
<v A>Yes, it was essentially.

901
00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:02.429
<v C>Alien 1 was good to change the game.

902
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.989
<v B>I think, like, 2 was too buddy cop for me, bro.

903
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.309
<v C>Nah, dude was like, do you know.

904
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:08.190
<v B>How to use one of these?

905
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.349
<v A>Yeah, I don't know what, like, to.

906
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.230
<v A>To me, Terminator 2 is the best mixture

907
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.510
<v A>of CG, live action.

908
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.789
<v B>That was incredible. Yeah.

909
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.469
<v A>Like, just action altogether at the time. And like,

910
00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:27.610
<v A>a decent fucking story for an action movie.

911
00:36:28.159 --> 00:36:30.239
<v B>So here's the thing. I didn't see Terminator 2 as a child.

912
00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:31.239
<v A>Okay.

913
00:36:31.239 --> 00:36:32.800
<v B>This is what separates us here at this table.

914
00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:33.519
<v C>Oh.

915
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.199
<v A>I mean, you're. You're almost as old as I am. I. I think we probably

916
00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:38.239
<v A>older than you are.

917
00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:40.360
<v C>Like, by how much? How much?

918
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.159
<v B>By very little. But I. By very little.

919
00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:44.199
<v A>I think we may have seen it around the same time.

920
00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:45.440
<v B>No, I saw it, like, as an adult.

921
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.239
<v C>Oh.

922
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:46.800
<v B>Oh.

923
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.679
<v A>Like you waited.

924
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.000
<v B>Yeah, I just never saw it. And then I was like, let me see what this Terminator 2

925
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
<v B>things about. I was just like, meh. Whereas Terminator 1

926
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.679
<v B>I saw as a child. Like, I was probably four

927
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.119
<v B>on TV or something, and My parents were just, like, ignoring me,

928
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.679
<v B>and I was like, this is terrifying.

929
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.880
<v A>It's pretty scary.

930
00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:07.159
<v B>Same thing with Total Recall, by the way. Total Recall still terrifies me to this day.

931
00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:10.440
<v A>Total Recall is another one of those, but that's that. That one director

932
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.440
<v A>who also did Starship Troopers and that

933
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.199
<v A>movie terrified me forever. And he also did RoboCop.

934
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.800
<v C>Yeah, I love RoboCop.

935
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.400
<v B>I'll buy that for a dollar.

936
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.639
<v A>Yeah, he didn't do part two or three, if I remember correctly.

937
00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:23.760
<v B>No, part three was bad, though.

938
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.789
<v A>Yeah. There was another direction.

939
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.869
<v C>New RoboCop was also kind of booty.

940
00:37:27.869 --> 00:37:29.550
<v B>It was okay. It was fun.

941
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.789
<v C>Nobody did see the new Judge Dread. Yeah, the new Dread was

942
00:37:32.789 --> 00:37:33.429
<v C>awesome, but.

943
00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:36.670
<v B>It was like a different take on Dread. New RoboCop

944
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.550
<v B>was RoboCop again.

945
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.630
<v A>Yeah, but they tried to modernize it. Make him

946
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.389
<v A>into, like, cyborg ninja.

947
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:42.750
<v C>Yeah.

948
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.590
<v B>Which is better? We like cyborg ninjas better.

949
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:44.989
<v A>Yeah.

950
00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:48.389
<v C>The actor for the Dread was really great, though. I always forget

951
00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:48.789
<v C>his name.

952
00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:49.789
<v A>Madamada.

953
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.400
<v B>I need healing. Joel Kinnaman

954
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.519
<v B>is the new RoboCop.

955
00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:56.679
<v C>No, no, not the RoboCop.

956
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.480
<v B>Joel Urban.

957
00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.719
<v C>Carl Urban is shit. That guy's awesome.

958
00:37:59.719 --> 00:38:00.559
<v A>Fucking love that guy.

959
00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:03.159
<v B>Yeah, he's super cool. I love his bones in Star Trek.

960
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.400
<v C>Oh, yeah, he's great.

961
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.480
<v A>I. That, like, some, like.

962
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.440
<v A>I don't know what, like, kind of God exists that they

963
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:11.800
<v A>can make a.

964
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.679
<v B>Dread sequel because they're talking about making a Dread show.

965
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.320
<v A>I seen it, and it's kind of like. It's

966
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.079
<v A>a 5050 thing where, like, I think that article is a.

967
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.900
<v A>And snag a lie at the same time. It's a weird

968
00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:28.900
<v A>fucking kind of situation,

969
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.940
<v A>but I really like that movie. That movie surprised

970
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.900
<v A>the shit out of me because it was

971
00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:38.780
<v A>the Raid Redemption. But Judge Judd.

972
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.860
<v C>Have you seen the Redemption, though? Oh, my

973
00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.980
<v C>God. That movie's so good.

974
00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.260
<v B>Oh, my God.

975
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.019
<v C>But I saw it.

976
00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:47.860
<v B>It's called Dread.

977
00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:50.619
<v A>Yeah, exactly. If you saw Dread, you saw the movie.

978
00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:53.659
<v C>It's martial arts dread. But it's so

979
00:38:53.659 --> 00:38:55.179
<v C>good if Dread threw.

980
00:38:55.179 --> 00:38:58.139
<v A>A kick or two. Okay, you'd seen the Raid Redemption,

981
00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:01.579
<v A>man. No, but there are some scenes that are real. Like.

982
00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:04.860
<v B>No, I went through a phase, though, where I only watched, like, Hong Kong action movies.

983
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.900
<v C>Well, this one is, like.

984
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.460
<v B>Watch them.

985
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.579
<v C>This is, like, Korean or something. It's. I mean, it's not a Chinese

986
00:39:09.739 --> 00:39:12.780
<v C>or Japanese or. It might look. It might be, like, Thai. I'm not

987
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.219
<v C>sure. I'm pretty sure it's Thai, actually.

988
00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:17.300
<v A>I'm pretty sure you're racist, but, man.

989
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.300
<v C>That movie's fucking Wild, dude. Holy hell. If all you guys

990
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.750
<v C>out there haven't seen the Redemption, watch it.

991
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.469
<v B>Redeem yourself.

992
00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:26.269
<v C>Good. Part two. I think we're in a little jumping the Sharky.

993
00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:29.590
<v B>Isn't the Raid Redemption already part two? Because it has, like, a tagline.

994
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.909
<v C>No, no. Part one. There's the Raid two. No. Yeah.

995
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.710
<v B>They don't know. Yeah, that's how you name a movie.

996
00:39:36.269 --> 00:39:37.230
<v A>You name a movie.

997
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.630
<v C>I heard it was only Redemption. When I went to see it, it was called

998
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.670
<v C>the Raid. But then in, like, when I saw that, when the movie started, it was

999
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.590
<v C>like the Raid Redemption, I was like, okay, I guess.

1000
00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:50.030
<v C>Sure. And I had no idea what I was walking into in that movie. All my friends at the time, like,

1001
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.159
<v C>oh, let's go watch this movie. And I was like, I guess, whatever. And then we

1002
00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:56.239
<v C>saw it, and it opens up and I'm like, okay, so no kind of generic action movie.

1003
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.360
<v C>And then it just hits the fan and you're like, okay, here

1004
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.679
<v C>we go. And you're just, like, stuck in your chair.

1005
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.159
<v B>Does anyone say, yippee ki yay, motherfucker?

1006
00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:04.599
<v C>No.

1007
00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:06.320
<v A>Because that's the best Christmas movie.

1008
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.840
<v B>That is the best Christmas show you ever made.

1009
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.360
<v A>Ever made. And, like, hands down, no one can't

1010
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.760
<v A>deny it.

1011
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.920
<v B>We'll get together, have a few laughs.

1012
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.559
<v C>Number. We had a lot of interesting shots. I was watching, like, a.

1013
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.429
<v C>Like, a mini documentary on YouTube about, like, that movie and, like, certain shots,

1014
00:40:22.429 --> 00:40:25.550
<v C>like, they use that movie as a lot of examples for, like, how to make different shots and how.

1015
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.389
<v C>The way that they shot

1016
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.469
<v C>one.

1017
00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:32.670
<v A>Okay, okay. Because I was hoping that you weren't talking about the Raid

1018
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.070
<v A>Redemption.

1019
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.230
<v C>Oh, no, no, no. Die Hard. Die Hard. And how they did, like, different shots and different,

1020
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.309
<v C>like, angles and stuff to get certain effects from. Different from, like,

1021
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:41.349
<v C>different scenes and all the. Man, this is crazy.

1022
00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:44.309
<v B>Yeah. I think I saw the same video, actually. Were they, like,

1023
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.429
<v B>give you an example of what the scene would have looked like? Like.

1024
00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:47.789
<v C>Yes.

1025
00:40:47.789 --> 00:40:48.190
<v B>Wider.

1026
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:51.389
<v C>Yes. Or, like, wider or, like, if they would have been, like, a little

1027
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.630
<v C>different camera. Like, like, cut to, like, an opposite side

1028
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.909
<v C>cut.

1029
00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.150
<v B>That's a really good video. Yeah.

1030
00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.750
<v C>That was awesome. I think you might have actually shown that video to me, funny enough.

1031
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.869
<v B>Maybe. I mean, I don't know. Yeah.

1032
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.670
<v C>Pretty good.

1033
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:08.309
<v B>Yeah. So basically, teamwork makes the

1034
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.829
<v B>dream work.

1035
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.469
<v C>Until it doesn't.

1036
00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:11.190
<v B>Until it doesn't.

1037
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.269
<v C>Then you have to make the dream work.

1038
00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:13.250
<v B>So it's kind of like Die Hard.

1039
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.000
<v A>Right?

1040
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.079
<v B>Like, you may have Reginald Val Johnson outside. That might

1041
00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:18.760
<v B>be your dude.

1042
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.159
<v A>Right.

1043
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.719
<v C>But if you ain't.

1044
00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:21.159
<v B>Yeah.

1045
00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:22.400
<v A>But if you're stepping on all that.

1046
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.599
<v B>Class, you gotta be John McLean.

1047
00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.800
<v C>Yeah. All day, every day,

1048
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.320
<v C>so.

1049
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.199
<v A>And then don't forget to redemption your raids.

1050
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.840
<v B>Yeah.

1051
00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:34.000
<v C>And Airbender, the last one.

1052
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.239
<v A>Oh, and then there's always gonna be a twist. Important,

1053
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.130
<v A>what a twist and everything.

1054
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.610
<v C>Just be prepared for the twist and see if you can handle it emotionally.

1055
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.090
<v B>What does this make me think about my life now?

1056
00:41:48.369 --> 00:41:49.250
<v C>You're scum.

1057
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.969
<v A>You might end up becoming, you know,

1058
00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:55.650
<v A>sad. And you may end up in the Rain Man. And,

1059
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.570
<v A>you know, you just gotta persevere like John Fogerty.

1060
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.050
<v C>But if you become sad, Keanu, is that a good thing?

1061
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.320
<v B>Well, I mean, just light that John Wick and let it burn.

1062
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:07.389
<v C>Yay.

1063
00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:07.829
<v A>Yo.

1064
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.639
<v C>This has been weekly deliverables episode?

1065
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.989
<v A>16. Because it's just gone everywhere,

1066
00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:16.429
<v A>this one.

1067
00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:17.269
<v B>Way off the rails.

1068
00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.269
<v A>I mean, I think now it's to be expected. Like.

1069
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:24.469
<v B>Yeah. I think that we do, like, a set of really

1070
00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:27.190
<v B>focused episodes, and we just go off the rails. Crazy.

1071
00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:27.750
<v A>Yeah.

1072
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.190
<v B>I think that's normal.

1073
00:42:29.269 --> 00:42:32.309
<v C>I think the next episode I'm really looking forward to because I have a lot to

1074
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:33.110
<v C>say about this next one.

1075
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:33.860
<v B>Okay.

1076
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.460
<v C>But you're just gonna have to listen to it.

1077
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:35.699
<v B>Yeah.

1078
00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:36.340
<v C>To find out.

1079
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.500
<v B>Just gonna have to wait and see.

1080
00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:41.019
<v C>All right, well, I've been Pedro.

1081
00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:41.739
<v B>Oh. I've been Mark.

1082
00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:42.699
<v A>And I've been Alex.

1083
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.300
<v C>All right, see you guys later. Bye.
